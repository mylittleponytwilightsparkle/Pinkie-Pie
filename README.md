Flourish of Nihility and Desperation
People say positivity is good for you. I disagree. Negative thoughts fuel me, they keep me alive, they keep me going, running,never falling.
If I possess too much positive thoughts, I will cease to exist. I will just be like the fools out there, trying to spread positivity to the world.
Big big joke. The world has already fallen into Chaos. I bath in it everyday. I am used to it. That's exactly why I can recognise it while others can't.
I will not change it. It will stay this way. Behold the power of Chaos.
